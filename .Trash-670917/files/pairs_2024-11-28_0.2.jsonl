During the a priori analysis, and according to these research results, the lecturers agreed to ask that question-answer maps to be included in students' intermediate and final reports. Although explicit training in the use of these maps was planned for the first session, it was not offered. The lack of this training was not considered critical because the students had used maps in the reports submitted for the previous case studies. However, despite their previous work, and because of the lack of a specific teaching session, students did not spontaneously use questions to describe the knowledge structure during the SRP, but only incorporated them in their intermediate and final reports upon the lecturers' request. They did not use them as a communication tool among peers.

TSGN consists of diverse interaction modules and temporal dependencies modules. These modules are constructed based on the transformer structure. TSGN treats the traffic scene in its entirety and encodes the agents' dynamics, surrounding lane segments, and interactions among them across time steps. In addition, we present a Hierarchical Lane Transformer module inside TSGN to capture the influence of the road network on the future motion of target agents. Unlike most approaches that use the full structural information of the surrounding road network, the Hierarchical Lane Transformer only selects the most probable lane segments which could have an impact on the future behavior of the target agent.
