It has a remarkably low false alarm rate (less than 1 spurious sign in 150 minutes of operation). Evaluation of the performances of our system at night and in tunnels is currently in progress, and encouraging. Some still ongoing work is focusing on eliminating the remaining ~1% misclassifications, and lowering the current ~10% miss-rate, by adding a complementary sign recognition scheme. Also, a parallel work already done in another context [START_REF] Lauffenburger | Navigation As a Virtual Sensor for Enhanced Lighting Preview Control[END_REF] for extracting cartographic information from GPS navigation maps, has been extended for extracting also speed limit information. We have thus begun to develop a framework for fusion of the output of visuallydetected speed limits with GPS cartographic speed limit data. Preliminary experiments show quite promising results for a final system that could take into account those two complementary sources.

It has a remarkably low false alarm rate (less than 1 spurious sign in 150 minutes of operation). Evaluation of the performances of our system at night and in tunnels is currently in progress, and encouraging. Some still ongoing work is focusing on eliminating the remaining ~1% misclassifications, and lowering the current ~10% miss-rate, by adding a complementary sign recognition scheme. Also, a parallel work already done in another context [START_REF] Lauffenburger | Navigation As a Virtual Sensor for Enhanced Lighting Preview Control[END_REF] for extracting cartographic information from GPS navigation maps, has been extended for extracting also speed limit information. We have thus begun to develop a framework for fusion of the output of visuallydetected speed limits with GPS cartographic speed limit data. Preliminary experiments show quite promising results for a final system that could take into account those two complementary sources.

These results lead to two potential scenarios. First, a lower budget FPGA could efficiently replace the Xilinx Virtex-7 xc7vx485tffg1761-2 and still reach the same performance. The second option is to increase the output framerate by duplicating the LASSR core on the current FPGA device, and executing each instance in parallel on independent blocks of the input source. Since the current HW prototype consumes few hardware resources, we decide to implement four parallel instances of LASSR (named LASSR4), each of them processing a quarter of the input image. As expected, the resulting LASSR4 implementation is 4 times faster and reaches 4K SR at 68 fps. It consumes 60285 Slices LUT, 88 BRAMs, and 1260 DSP blocks, representing 19.86% of total Slices LUT, 8.54% of total BRAMs, and 45% of total DSP in the targeted Virtex-7 device.
